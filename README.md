![code-wizard2](https://github.com/nayaba/pw-organizing/assets/9198401/019d9af8-08ce-4b35-b440-8f7e26dbe108)

Hey future web wizards! Let's get your digital wizard tower set up with all the magical tools you'll need. We're talking about your digital workspace today‚Äîwhere you'll conjure code and collaborate with fellow apprentices.

### Objective

In order to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration, students will learn to navigate and utilize Slack, and configure Zoom for screen sharing on Mac.

### Mastering Communication Tools

First off, you're going to become a communication ninja with Slack and Zoom. Why? Because even wizards need to talk to their guild!

- **Slack**: You'll grab the [desktop app](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/downloads) and join the ["GA Immersive Students"](http://ga-students.slack.com) space. Get it on your phone, too. Set up your profile with a pic and your name (don't forget those pronouns) so we know who's casting the awesome code spells.

    **Pro Tip:** Direct message yourself on Slack as your primary note-taking during class - forget trying to hand write notes, typing beats quill and ink every time. Also keep a stack of sticky notes handy for those spells‚ÄîI mean commands‚Äîyou can't forget. And use [‚Äúcode blocks‚Äù](https://youtu.be/tRIIk22GylE?si=4fvUU2VYxQzWVUkU) in Slack when sharing your code!
    If Slack is completely new to you, [check out this video overview](https://youtu.be/Yt66-u5UVOM?si=j5HBcGkXOht3MoOn)

- **Zoom**: Change your Zoom name to match Slack to avoid any identity mix-ups. Then, make sure Zoom can show your screen to the class by giving it the right permissions in your Mac's System Preferences. You can do this by selecting the ```Security & Privacy``` option, click the ```Privacy tab```, scroll down to ```Screen Recording```, and finally **check the option for zoom.us.**

### Organizing the Learning Environment

Next, let‚Äôs talk about your workspace.

- **Digital Clean-Up**: Arrange your digital desktop like a pro. You'll be juggling lots of windows, so let's make it snappy with [Rectangle for Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_s6gqWeuVc) or [snapping layouts on Windows 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b11saSsXwPs). This will let you organize your windows with a flick of the wrist (or a click of the mouse).

Above we have an example of a desktop setup using Rectangle or Snapping Layouts.  Let's break down an ace setup:

- **Bottom Left - Communication Hub**: Keep Slack open down here. It's your lifeline to the class. Not only will your instructor share links and resources, but it's also where you can fire off questions faster than a compiler can spit out errors. Make friends with the Parking Lot or Questions channel to keep the convo flowing.

- **Top Left - The Window to Your Work**: This spot is reserved for a browser window where you can preview the app you're crafting. Or it could be where you park the written lesson for those times you need to snag a code snippet on the fly.

- **Right Side - Code Central**: Dedicate the right side of your screen to your code editor. This is your creative corner, where you'll be coding in tandem with your instructor. Sometimes it's going to be VSCode, other times an in-browser editor like CodePen. 

And here's a pro tip: Embrace the power of a second monitor. Zoom on one, work on the other. It's a game-changer. No second screen? An iPad or any tablet can be your wingman. Trust us, it's a wise move‚Äîyou'll thank yourself for the extra real estate when you're deep-diving into code and need to keep an eye on the lesson. Don't shortchange your learning experience; a second screen isn't just nice, it's essential.


### Keyboard Shortcuts for Mac and Windows

Now, here‚Äôs some real magic: keyboard shortcuts. These are like secret incantations to make your computer do your bidding instantly.  As was mentioned earlier, jot any shortcuts you want to remember down on a sticky note and keep it near your computer.

#### For Mac Users:
- **Command + C**: Copy text.
- **Command + V**: Paste text.
- **Command + X**: Cut text.
- **Command + A**: Select all text in a window.
- **Command + Tab**: Switch between applications.
- **Command + Space**: Open Spotlight for quick searches.
- **Control + Command + Space**: Open the Character Viewer, where you can insert emojis and symbols.

#### For Windows Users:
- **Ctrl + C**: Copy text.
- **Ctrl + V**: Paste text.
- **Ctrl + X**: Cut text.
- **Ctrl + A**: Select all text in a window.
- **Alt + Tab**: Switch between applications.
- **Windows + S**: Open Search.
- **Windows + .(period)**: Open the emoji panel.

Remember, young sorcerer, setting up your digital space is like preparing for a grand quest. Get these basics down, and you'll be casting JavaScript spells like a pro in no time! üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®üñ•Ô∏è
