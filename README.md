Hey future web wizards! Let's get your digital wizard tower set up with all the magical tools you'll need. We're talking about your digital workspace today‚Äîwhere you'll conjure code and collaborate with fellow apprentices.

### Objective

In order to facilitate seamless communication and collaboration, students will learn to navigate and utilize Slack, and configure Zoom for screen sharing on Mac.

### Mastering Communication Tools

First off, you're going to become a communication ninja with Slack and Zoom. Why? Because even wizards need to talk to their guild!

- **Slack**: You'll grab the [desktop app](https://slack.com/intl/en-in/downloads) and join the ["GA Immersive Students"](http://ga-students.slack.com) space. Get it on your phone, too. Set up your profile with a pic and your name (don't forget those pronouns) so we know who's casting the awesome code spells.
  - Pro Tip: Direct message yourself on Slack as your primary note-taking during class - forget trying to hand write notes, typing beats quill and ink every time. Also keep a stack of sticky notes handy for those spells‚ÄîI mean commands‚Äîyou can't forget. And use [‚Äúcode blocks‚Äù](https://youtu.be/tRIIk22GylE?si=4fvUU2VYxQzWVUkU) in Slack when sharing your code!
  - If Slack is completely new to you, [check out this video overview](https://youtu.be/Yt66-u5UVOM?si=j5HBcGkXOht3MoOn)

- **Zoom**: Change your Zoom name to match Slack to avoid any identity mix-ups. Then, make sure Zoom can show your screen to the class by giving it the right permissions in your Mac's System Preferences. You can do this in your System Preferences. Select the ```Security & Privacy``` option, click the ```Privacy tab```, scroll down to ```Screen Recording```, and finally **check the option for zoom.us.**

### Organizing the Learning Environment

Next, let‚Äôs talk about your workspace.

- **Digital Clean-Up**: Arrange your digital desktop like a pro. You'll be juggling lots of windows, so let's make it snappy with [Rectangle for Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_s6gqWeuVc) or [snapping layouts on Windows 11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b11saSsXwPs). This will let you organize your windows with a flick of the wrist (or a click of the mouse).

### Keyboard Shortcuts for Mac and Windows

Now, here‚Äôs some real magic: keyboard shortcuts. These are like secret incantations to make your computer do your bidding instantly.  As was mentioned earlier, jot any shortcuts you want to remember down on a sticky note and keep it near your computer.

#### For Mac Users:
- **Command + C**: Copy text.
- **Command + V**: Paste text.
- **Command + X**: Cut text.
- **Command + A**: Select all text in a window.
- **Command + Tab**: Switch between applications.
- **Command + Space**: Open Spotlight for quick searches.
- **Control + Command + Space**: Open the Character Viewer, where you can insert emojis and symbols.

#### For Windows Users:
